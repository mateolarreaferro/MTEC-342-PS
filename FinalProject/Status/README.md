#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have implemented the multitiuch mechanism using what we learned in class, finished the JUCE OSC sender tutorial, and have started working on the Max Patch that will receive the information coming from the phone.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not figured out exactly how the interface should look like. I have not implemented the OSC protocol in the multitiouch project, I have not decided how to separate OSC messages based on each finger.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I'm not sure what's the best way to debug as I test (I'm in Xcode). I'm not sure how to organize the OSC data and when it should be sent to Max (rate).
