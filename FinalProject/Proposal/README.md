# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

SweetTouch

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project is about creating a wavetable synthesizer.")

My project is about creating an intuitive OSC controller/sender that uses MultiTouch to control OpenGL visuals in Jitter. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Sweet Touch is an intuitive and versatile mobile application inspired by Touch OSC but with a stronger focus on the interface. The application will enable performers to control music and visuals by moving their fingers in a somewhat 'empty' screen. By adding haptic response, Sweet Touch will emulate (to some extent) the action of playing an instrument



SweetTouch is an intuitive and versaitle mobile OSC instrument that enables a friendly 


## If you are planning to combine EP-353's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to EP-353, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I intend to use this controller for my final Jitter performance in EP-426. My intention is to create the performance 'controller' in MTEC-342 and the Open GL visuals in EP-426. 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A mobile application that sends OSC messages to Max MSP.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A mobile application with an intuitive interface that sends OSC messages to Max MSP.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A mobile application with an intuitive interface (uses multitouch) that controls OpenGL visuals in Jitter. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
