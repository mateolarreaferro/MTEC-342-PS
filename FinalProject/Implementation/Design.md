## Sweet Touch: OSC Controller and Synth




## *Structure*

The system has three different aspects: OSC Sender, Multitouch, and Synth. 

1. OSC Sender: It sends X and Y finger coordinates to an OSC receiver. 
2. Multitouch: Finger class that allows the user to use up to 10 fingers at the same time. All of their positions can be tracked. 
3. Synth: It is a low frequency oscillator with a Low Pass Filter that allows the user to feel the touch without necessarily relying on the visual. 

## *Inspiration*

Iannis Xenakis [UPIC 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNPWub-MNxg): The notion of physically interacting with the sound. Composing through gesture.

Doga Buse Cavdir's ["Felt Sound"](https://www.dogacavdir.com/feltsound): Using very low frequencies to enable other non-visual interactions with the interface.
