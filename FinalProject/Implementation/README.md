#### Sweet Touch

Sweet Touch is a mobile application inspired by Iannis Xenakis' dream of composing music through the act of drawing. In his work, [UPIC 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNPWub-MNxg) , the composer emphasizes the use of gestures as an expressive grammar that is appropiate for music making. In the case of this application, these gestures can be mapped to visuals and various types of sounds (or any other data receiver). The project comes with a Jitter example created in Max MSP that is controlled from JUCE.
