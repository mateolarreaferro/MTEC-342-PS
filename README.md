# MTEC-342: Programming for Mobile Music - Fall 2021

## Mateo Larrea's Repository
In this repository I will upload all of the biweekly problem sets created for this class. Some of my files are simple C++ problems and others are entire JUCE projects that can be opened in Xcode or Android Studio.

## Description
In this class, students learn to develop interactive music systems on mobile devices using Xcode and Android Studio IDEs. The class explores interactive music systems that provide novice users access to music-making through a visual representation of often complex underlying musical systems. These systems provide a sonic-centric approach in which the end-user may trigger, generate, modify, or transform music on the fly. Students in the class create mobile apps with concepts such as algorithmic composition, sound/visual synthesis, signal processing, visual design, database management, and distributed networking. Examples of these apps include Bjork's Biophilia, Electroplankton by Nintendo, and Ocarina by Smule. Students develop essential skills that support careers in music technology industries such as sound design, video games, instrument manufacturing, and music streaming.

## Expectations
All students in MTEC-342 must use [GitHub](https://github.com/) to submit their problem sets and the final project. This class is about computer programming and developing software applications. It is essential that students pursuing software engineering skills to learn how to use a version control system such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/). Industry jobs commonly require version control skills. 

You are also expected to:

- attend fourteen lectures,
- take a syllabus quiz,
- solve four problem sets, 
- complete a mid-term project, and
- design and implement a final project.

## Learning Objectives
Along the way of this course, students will

- learn C++ Programming Language;
- understand how computer programs are structured for mobile programming;
- use logic and problem-solving skills to design simple musical programs;
- comprehend the major concepts common to C++ language, such as functions, loops, abstraction, algorithms, memory, data structures, resource management;
- write computer programs for sound synthesis and signal processing;
- use integrated development environments (IDEs) to build computer applications;
- use version control to organize programming projects;
- understand using C++ frameworks; and
- be able to read the documentation for Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

## Recommended Books
Most class materials will be online, and no books are required in this course, but the following books may be resourceful to students:

[**The C++ Programming Language**](https://www.amazon.com/C-Programming-Language-4th/dp/0321563840/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=The+C%2B%2B+Programming+Language&qid=1629827218&sr=8-2)  
Bjarne Stroustrup
Addison Wesley Publishing, 2013  
ISBN 0-321-56384-0

## Mid-term Project
Students are required to work on a mid-term project in this course. The mid-term project is students' opportunity to take the learnings in the course so far and apply them in a creative context. The mid-term project phase will start at week 6, and students will have two weeks to complete their project.

Week|Milestone|Deadline
:--|:--|:--
Week 6| Kickoff | October 13, 2021
Week 7| Status Report | October 20, 2021
Week 8| Implementation | October 27, 2021

## Final Project
Students are required to work on a final project in this course. The final project is students' opportunity to take their newfound savvy with programming out for a spin and develop their own piece of software. The final project phase will start at week 12, and students will have two weeks to complete their final project.

Week|Milestone|Deadline
:--|:--|:--
Week 13| Proposal| December 1, 2021
Week 14| Status Report| December 8, 2021
Week 15| Implementation| December 15, 2021

## Problem Sets and Final Project Submission Policy
The instructor will post descriptions for problem sets and the final project on the class material GitHub repository. The instructions will not be on [OL](ol.berklee.edu).

### Problem Sets
- Students must submit their problem sets and projects using [GitHub](github.com) and not [OL](ol.berklee.edu).
- Late problem sets will incur a penalty of 5% each day.
- Problem sets and projects are due on the date specified before the class. If your class starts at 9:00 am, then you must submit them before that class time.
- Your problem sets/projects are one day late if you submit them after the class starts on the date specified. For example, if your class begins at 9:00 am, and you submit your problem set on 9:01 am, your problem set is one date late, and you will lose 5%.
- After the next class cycle (two days after the due date), your assignments/projects are two days late, and you will lose 10%.
- The instructor will not accept problem sets one week after the due date (cut-off day).
- After the cut-off day, you will receive a grade of 0.
- Make-up submission after the due date will incur late penalties.
- No make-up submission is allowed for the problem sets after the cut-off time.
- The latest submission of your problem set will be graded.

### Mid-term and Final Projects
- The submission policy for both mid-term and final projects is the same as problem sets.
- Late submission for the final project is not accepted.

### General Advice
- No extra credit work exists in this course.
- Every late submission will add a burden on your time to complete the next ones.
- Students are encouraged to submit their problem sets and projects on time, even if they are incomplete.
- If you are having issues with your problem sets and projects, meet with the tutor or speak with your instructor immediately.

## Grade Determination
The instructor will determine your final grade by considering the following components at the indicated weights:

Description|Grade
---|---:|
Syllabus Quiz | 5%
Attendance | 10%
Bi-weekly Problem Sets | 35%
Mid-term Project | 25%
Final Project | 25%

Problem sets and projects are evaluated using grading rubrics. The rubrics will ordinarily involve the correctness, design, style, and documentation of your software programs.

Keep in mind that the [OL](ol.berklee.edu) is used to give you feedback (click on the [Gradebook](https://ol.berklee.edu/grade/report/index.php?id=134448) link under the <u>Course Navigator</u> to view feedback) on your grades. However, **the cumulative grade you see on [OL](ol.berklee.edu) is not a reliable indicator of your final grade standing.** [OL](ol.berklee.edu) does not weigh weekly problem sets and the final project accurately. [OL](ol.berklee.edu) also does not take attendance into account.

Know that MTEC-342 draws quite the spectrum of students, including "those less comfortable," "those more comfortable," and those in between. However, what ultimately matters in this course is not where you end up relative to your classmates but where you end up relative to yourself when you began.

## Attendance Policy
- Remote attendance is not permitted.
- Students may be absent (excused or unexcused) from the class for one week out of the entire semester with no penalty.
- Students are allowed a second week of absences at no penalty if they have documentation ahead of time indicating that they are sick or participated in a College/Conservatory-sponsored trip, concert, or performance.
- Students will fail the class if they miss more than four weeks' worth of class time.
- Students will earn 10 points for each class they fully attended for their attendance, meaning no late arrival and early departure.
- Late arrival and early departure from the class will result in losing 2 points.
- Students will earn 0 points for not attending the class after their first absence and the second absence without any documentation indicating legitimate reasons.
- Students are late if they come in five minutes after the class starts.
- Students early departed if they leave before the instructor dismisses the class.
- Three late arrivals or early departures constitute one absence.
- If the departure is severely early (e.g., left the class right after attendance is taken), a student will be marked as absent.
- Students made an early departure if they do not tell the instructor before the class starts and take off before the class officially ended.
- Students must be present for mid-term and final project presentation day. If students are absent, they will lose 5% of their total grade.
