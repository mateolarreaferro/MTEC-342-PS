#Problem Set 2:

## MTEC-342: Programming in Juce (C++)

### Description:

For this Problem Set I created two programs: Problem1.1.cpp & Problem1.2

**Problem 1.1** consisted in writing three functions to get the min, max, and average of an array.
**Problem 1.2** consisted in creating sliders in juce to control parameters like the frequency, amplitude, buffer size, etc. of an osc.


### Build and Run Commands:
To build Problem2.1:

	 clang++ Problem1.1.cpp -o Problem1.1
	 

To run the compiled Problem2.1 use: 

	 ./Problem1.1
	

### Acknowledgement:
I used the information provided in class by my teacher, Akito van Troyer and Juce's documentation.
