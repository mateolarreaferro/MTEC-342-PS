#Problem Set 2:

## MTEC-342: Programming in Juce (C++)

### Description:

For this Problem Set I created two programs: Problem1.1.cpp & Problem1.2

**Problem 1.1** consisted in writing a program that would take an integer from the user using std::cin and then transform it to a hexadecimal and octal number.

**Problem 1.2** consisted in adding two sliders in Juce to control the font size and color of a text. I replaced the string "Hello JUCE" with a ":)!" to make it a little bit more personal. 


### Build and Run Commands:
To build Problem1.1:

	 clang++ Problem1.1.cpp -o Problem1.1
	 

To run the compiled Problem1.1 use: 

	 ./Problem1.1
	

### Acknowledgement:
I used the information provided in class by my teacher, Akito van Troyer and Juce's documentation.
